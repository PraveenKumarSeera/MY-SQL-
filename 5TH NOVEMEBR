Matrices find practical uses in diverse fields. For instance, in transportation systems, matrices help
model traffic flows and optimize routes, enhancing efficiency and reducing congestion.
In genetics, matrices aid in analyzing genetic data, such as DNA sequences, enabling scientists to
uncover patterns and relationships for medical research and diagnosis.
In weather forecasting, matrices assist meteorologists in processing complex atmospheric data,
allowing accurate prediction models to be created and enhancing our ability to prepare for severe
weather events
